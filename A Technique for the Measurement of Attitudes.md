# A Technique for the Measurement of Attitudes

## I. INTRODUCTION*

Attempts to measure the traits of character and personality are nearly as old as techniques for the measurement of intellectual capacity, yet it can scarcely be claimed that they have achieved a similar success. Part, at least, of the difficulty has lain in the statistical difficulties which are encountered when everyday aspects of social behavior, ordinarily handled as qualitative affairs, are treated from the mathematical point of view. The present study, although part of a larger investigation undertaken in 1929 by Gardner Murphy, aims primarily at the solution of a technical problem which has arisen in relation to the quantitative aspects of the study of social attitudes.

The history and present status of research upon personality traits in general, and social attitudes in particular, have been so thoroughly surveyed by Murphy (21, pp. 381-386, and 22, pp. 558-690), Bain (4), Vetter (41), Katz and Allport (16), Watson (43), and others, that no useful purpose would be served in attempting such a study here.

Nevertheless, among the hundreds of efforts to measure social attitudes during the last few years, the careful procedures developed by Thurstone (34, 38) have naturally and rightly received special attention. These are characterized by a special endeavor to equalize the step-intervals from one attitude to the next in the attitude scale, using the familiar methods of psychophysics for such determinations. The Thurstone methods have been shown to yield a satisfactory reliability, and, in terms of correlations between scores and case histories as evaluated by judges, a satisfactory validity (29).

Many obvious affinities appear between the present study and those of Thurstone, yet in a sense the present report constitutes a radical departure from the concepts which Thurstone has published, as, for example, in the use of judges.

A number of statistical assumptions are made in the application of his attitude scales,—e.g., that the scale values of the statements are independent of the attitude distribution of the readers who sort the statements (38, p. 92),—assumptions which, as Thurstone points out, have not been verified. The method is, moreover, exceedingly laborious. It seems legitimate to inquire whether it actually does its work better than the simpler scales which may be employed, and in the same breath to ask also whether it is not possible to construct equally reliable scales without making unnecessary statistical assumptions. Since so much is being published about attitude measurement, it seems worthwhile to raise these questions and to report on some results relative to the problem. It is feared that some will mistakenly interpret this article as an "attack" on Thurstone's methods. I therefore wish to emphasize in the strongest terms that I am simply endeavoring to call attention to certain problems of method, and that I am very far from convinced that the present data close the question.

## II. PROBLEM

From an historical point of view one fact deserves emphasis, namely the extraordinary interest in recent years in the problem of the "generality" or "specificity" of character traits—a problem which in its simplest form has to do with the question of the functional independence of social habits. Roughly speaking, the specificity theory would define personality as a composite of many independent habits, while those who emphasize the relative unity of character point to significant general factors which make for effective prediction from behavior in one situation to behavior in a different situation. It seems to the present writer that the problem of specificity has been greatly misunderstood by many writers upon social attitudes and that the value of such contributions as the present may lie chiefly in redirecting attention to those aspects of the specificity-generality problem upon which quantitative results are clear-cut and psychologically significant. It will be well first to consider briefly the logic of the specificity-generality problem, then to present and evaluate our data, and finally to undertake to find the psychological significance of our data in relation to the problem raised.

If an attitude be defined by the social psychologist as a tendency toward a particular response in a particular situation, it is clear that the number of definable attitudes existing in a given person at a given time will depend upon the range of stimuli to which he is subjected. But since it is possible to group stimuli in almost any conceivable manner and to classify and subclassify them indefinitely, it is strictly true that the number of attitudes which any given person possesses is almost infinite. This result is statistically as well as psychologically absurd. Exactly the same absurdity and the same obstacle to research is offered by those definitions of attitude which conceive them merely as verbal expressions or as indications of assent to or dissent from particular verbal expressions. The number of possible verbal combinations is, of course, infinite and the number of attitudes must on this basis likewise be so. It is clear then that those who have defined attitudes in the above two ways have not meant exactly what they have said. They have really intended to indicate not the actually discriminable tendencies to overt action or the verbal-response patterns but certain discernible groups of social responses. Within each group a family resemblance of the various responses is assumed, and each group of attitudes is supposed to show some distinguishable difference from every other group. If the analysis is pressed far enough, this turns out to mean that the attitude is a habit sufficiently compact and stable to be treated as a unit. It will, of course, be recognized that variations of an individual’s response within this sphere of a given “attitude,” together with differences between each attitude and the next, are involved. If it is my “attitude” to regard the eating of starches as a dietetic monstrosity, either an inherited dislike for such foods or a bundle of acquired tendencies directed towards bread, potatoes, rice, etc., must be assumed to exist. Whether we take the attitude therefore as an entity innate or learned, it is in either case not an inflexible and rigid element in personality (if, in fact, any such elements exist), but rather a certain range within which responses move.

On this basis one of our cardinal problems is to find whether social attitudes, in this sense, can be shown to be measurable, and if an affirmative answer is forthcoming, a serious attempt must be made to justify the separation of one attitude from others. For if there are no family differences between attitudes, there is simply one infinite series of attitudes. On this basis the measurement of attitudes could never mean anything more than the determination of an amount of some one tendency present, but what this one tendency actually is could never be defined.

Perhaps vaguely realizing this difficulty, many investigators in the field of attitude measurement have assumed a sharp distinction between different families of attitudes, and perfect resemblance or indeed identity between the members of any given family of responses. Take, for example, the frequent raising of questions as to whether there is a relation between internationalism and economic liberalism. Such terminology is based upon two assumptions: first, that there is an entity to be called internationalism, the boundaries of which can be so defined as to separate it from economic liberalism and permit one to tell which is which—otherwise the state ment is tautological—, second, it is assumed that within the sphere of internationalistic responses there is good prediction from one response to the next. Internationalism is treated as an entity such that the defining of a person’s internationalism on a given issue would define his internationalism on all others.

We have not been concerned up to the present, to define the term “attitude,” since the logic of the above argument seems to be the same when applied to either of two prevailing definitions of attitude. Contemporary definitions cluster about two chief conceptions: first, that attitudes are dispositions toward overt action; second, that they are verbal substitutes for overt action. The former usage seems to the present writer to be preferable.* The verbal declarations of opinion and attitude are regarded as an indirect method of measuring dispositions which are most easily signified and expressed in verbal form. It is desirable, however, to point out that the same considerations regarding specificity and generality apply to the verbal declarations as to other social habits. The same problem of group factors and special factors appears even when dealing with paper and pencil behavior.

Consequently whether attitudes be defined in terms of underlying dispositions toward overt action or in terms of mere verbal declarations, investigators have proceeded almost without question upon the assumption that social attitudes are grouped in patterns or clusters. A series of verbal propositions dealing with the same general social issue are assumed to be more or less equivalent, or at least to be closely related so as to permit prediction from a knowledge of a subject’s attitude on one issue to the same subject’s attitudes on other aspects of the same issue. Similarly, overt behavior favorable to or in opposition to a racial, national, religious, or economic group, is assumed to have some predictive value in relation to conduct in the future when the same group or class is again involved. Speaking generally, attitudes may be conceived as “clustered” or linked together; a general pro-Japanese attitude, for example, may show itself in a series of pro-Japanese verbal declarations or a series of pro-Japanese overt acts. In statistical language, a group factor is assumed at the outset. Now just as the student of mental organization recognizes group factors which vary greatly in their magnitude and significance, so the student of attitudes tends to think of relatively important group factors occurring in some attitude-areas and relatively unimportant ones in others. Here, however, the agreement among the investigators ends. In the few short years during which any serious statistical sophistication has existed in attitude research, much acrimony has been evident between those who are concerned to regard the group factors as slight and unimportant, and those who regard them as large and significant. Thus we find Bain (4) insisting that attitudes cluster together only when they constitute alternative verbalizations of the same conative tendency in relation to a specifically defined social situation. The various studies in the specificity of character traits have led to a widespread and, it must be admitted, highly uncritical acceptance of the view that verbal propositions have no predictive value for anything else in life except similar verbal propositions confronted by the same subject under the same circumstances. On the other hand, an excessively general view of character traits is naively assumed with almost equal frequency by writers who have discussed radicalism and conservatism, some of whom have defined the characteristics of radicals and conservatives, suggesting evidence as to the psychological mechanisms making for such general trends. Thus as early as 1924, H. T. Moore (20) defined five basic psychological characteristics predisposing towards radicalism as contrasted with conservatism, and as recently as 1929 and 1930 G. W. Allport (2, 3) has argued for a cluster of traits, chiefly intellectual, which make for radicalism on political, economic, and other social issues.

It seems to be high time to cut through the statistical confusion which has resulted from the whole specificity-generality argument, to bring out the actual points of disagreement which separate these rival groups of psychologists, to make clear the statistical assumptions involved in all such methods of reasoning, and above all to test empirically in an extensive way the actual coherence or clustering of attitudes on a variety of public issues.


> *If an exact definition be regarded as useful, the following (Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, 1904-1906, I, 374) is preferred: “relation of persons viewed as the expression of, or as affecting, feeling, opinion, intentions, etc.”


## III. PROCEDURE

The project conceived in 1929 by Gardner Murphy and the present writer aimed first of all to present a wide array of problems having to do with these five major “attitude areas”: international relations, race relations, economic conflict, political conflict and religion. The attitude areas best covered in the questionnaire are those of race relations, international relations, and economic conflict. It was our conviction that very high specificity would exist among the elements used in our questionnaire, except insofar as the questions clearly dealt with the same issues. On the basis of results obtained by C. W. Hunter (15), for example, in the field of Negro-white relations, it was believed that attitudes toward segregation, toward eating with the Negro and toward lynching would be independent, and that in general any one specific attitude toward the Negro would bear no clear relation to the attitudes on other issues. This, of course, does not mean that we expected to obtain the rather ideal specificity which would be indicated by a zero reliability (by the split-half method) when comparing pro-Negro attitudes on some items with pro-Negro attitudes on others. It does mean, however, that we expected fifteen attitudes dealing with nearly fifteen different issues in which the Negro is involved, to give exceedingly low split-half reliability, and that in order to obtain anything like a true “scale” for the measurement of such a thing as pro- or anti-Negro feeling, one would have to employ dozens or even scores of questions. In the same way, the specificity of opinions on international and economic issues was assumed to be so great that an enormous number of items would have to be used in order to give a satisfactory reliability for any scale which could be constructed. It is important to emphasize these expectations at the outset, since the results, although in some respects confirming our belief, have in general yielded remarkably clear-cut group factors, group factors which in the light of the small number of items used must be regarded as having, for the student subjects used, a status as clear as that enjoyed by group factors of immediate memory, verbal ability, and the like to which a number of statisticians have called attention.

The method by which the questionnaire was constructed was as follows. Having determined to study intensively the matter of international, inter-racial and economic attitudes, and, to a minor degree, political and religious attitudes, among large numbers of college students at typical American universities, a survey was made of the questionnaires already administered by other psychologists for these purposes. Among those which proved especially helpful were those of G. B. Neumann (23), C. W. Hunter (15) and R. W. George (9). In addition, about two hundred newspapers and magazines were rapidly surveyed during the autumn of 1929, declarations of opinion being culled for consideration, special emphasis being given to the more dogmatic types of opinion frequently found in editorials. A small number of questions were included from books, addresses and pamphlets, and a number were made up by the experimenters. Wherever it was possible to use questionnaire material which had previously been extensively tried out, and where, in a sense, “norms” were available, we preferred to use the questions exactly as they stood. In a few cases, it was necessary to abbreviate and simplify the questions in order to make sure that only one issue was involved and that ambiguity was avoided. In those instances in which we made up our own questions, we sought to emphasize simplicity, clarity, and brevity.

Without exception, the questions were presented in such a form as to permit a “judgment of value” rather than a “judgment of fact.” Phrases such as “The United States should,” or “We ought to,” or “No man should be allowed” constantly reappeared. In a few instances it may seem on first inspection that a question has to do with a question of fact, but closer analysis will reveal the highly arbitrary character of such “facts.” Perhaps the least desirable of all the questions used was the following: “Is war at present a biological necessity?” Such a question appears to many minds to be categorically a factual one; for example, from a neo-Malthusian point of view it may be regarded as capable only of an affirmative answer. The term “necessity,” however, refers here more to the student’s attitudes toward various wants than to any of those types of necessity which are discussed by physicists or logicians. This is not offered in defense of the use of this particular item, which is regarded as one which should have been omitted; this explanation is offered only to make clear that at least in the great majority of cases and, we hope, in all, the inquiry has to do with the wants, desires, conative dispositions of the subjects, not with their opinions regarding matters of fact.

One further generalization may be offered regarding the plan underlying the choices of questions. Since value judgments are required, it was conceived that every issue might be presented in such a way as to allow the subject to take sides as between two clearly opposed alternatives. Furthermore, each issue was so drawn that two conflicting groups of persons were either named or implied, and the subject allowed to affiliate himself with one or with the other group. In the struggle of the Negro, for example, to attain economic, political, or social equality, where the white man resists such equality, the subject has an opportunity either to take or to refuse to take the Negro standpoint. In the case of the conflict of relatively unfavored economic groups against those who enjoy special opportunities, and in the case of weaker nations which demand greater territorial or economic expansion than is at present permitted them, the same opportunity to ally oneself with one or the other of two opposing factions is involved. Again, it is not asserted that we have in all cases succeeded in framing an ideal “conflict issue.” We would urge, however, that the great majority of conflict issues covered in our survey are empirically important issues, in which students at American universities actually do have opportunity to take sides and with regard to which the great majority have heard repeated discussions; secondly, that the results constitute in themselves an empirical check on the degree of success with which a tendency to take the side of a given group does enter into our questions in such a way as to be empirically measured. High specificity would have meant, among other things, that we had certainly failed in finding any general pro-Negro, anti-Japanese, etc. attitudes, and would have led to statistical difficulties of various sorts in handling incoherent masses of unrelated material. The clear-cut generality of certain attitudes, such as pro-Negro, internationalism, etc., shows that it is precisely in the field of affiliation with or against certain social groups that the most definite results are obtained.

Through collaboration with instructors, the attitudes tests were given to undergraduates (chiefly male) in nine universities and colleges extending from Illinois to Connecticut and from Ohio and Pennsylvania to Virginia. (The names of the institutions cannot appropriately be printed here, only the Columbia College data, Group D, being identified.) The total number of individuals participating was somewhat above 2000 but the data here intensively analyzed were derived from only 650* persons. The attitudes test, called a SURVEY OF OPINIONS, was first given in the late fall of 1929 (to all groups except Group C and Group F which were given the test in 1931) and, by arrangement with instructors, a retest given 30 days later. Some items from the first test and many new items were included in this second test. The first test required on the average about 40 minutes and the retest a slightly longer time.

The kind of questionnaire material to be reported here falls into four main classes. In the first, questions were to be answered by a Yes, a question mark, or a No, as for example, “Do you favor the early entrance of the United States into the League of Nations?” YES ? NO. Next came a series of multiple-choice questions in which one of five possible answers was to be selected, for example: “Using the term ‘armaments’ to mean equipment devised for war rather than for police purposes, our policy should be to favor: (a) absolute and immediate disarmament of all nations, (b) rapid and drastic reduction of the armaments of all nations, (c) slow but steady reduction of all armaments, (d) maintenance for a long time of approximately the present military and naval strength of all the powers, (e) our free military and naval expansion unembarrassed by agreements with other nations.” Third, there was a series of propositions to be responded to by the words (a) strongly approve, (b) approve, (c) undecided, (d) disapprove, (e) strongly disapprove, for example: “All men who have the opportunity should enlist in the Citizens Military Training Camps.” Fourth, a series of abbreviated newspaper narratives about social conflicts, terminating in a sentence describing the outcome of this conflict, the student being asked to indicate his response to this outcome, for example: “A group of Japanese truck-farmers in Southern California, through their industry and lower standards of living, are able to undersell their American competitors. The American farmers insist that IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL WHITE PEOPLE TO PURCHASE ONLY FROM WHITE FARMERS.” This last form of question makes use of the same set of five responses mentioned above, strongly approve, approve, undecided, disapprove, and strongly disapprove.

## THE ATTITUDE SCALES

The different scales presented here have been given their respective names merely for convenience in referring to them. The names given them seem the most plausible, but to avoid any “jingle fallacy” it should be recognized that the scales measure merely what the different statements included in them involve.

In the SURVEY OF OPINIONS the statements did not appear consecutively as shown in the following scales but were scattered among many statements having to do with other attitudes.

## IV. RESULTS

The Sigma Method of Scoring

In order to compare one type of statement with another such as the "multiple choice" with the "strongly approve," it was necessary to devise some technique whereby they might be made comparable. In attempting to work out such a technique, it was noticed that a great number of the five-point statements, i.e. the "multiple choice" or "strongly approve" statements (in each case the subject being offered five alternatives from which to choose), yielded a distribution resembling a normal distribution.

Of the two distributions which were quite skewed, number 7 of the Negro scale, was the more skewed. The other was number 6 of the Negro scale. It is interesting to note that if a group of Southern students are included in these distributions they become



## VI. SUMMARY

This study has presented a different method of measuring attitudes from that ordinarily used. It has attempted to evaluate this method, both in its longer, more complex form and in its simpler form, and to compare it with other methods widely used. The results obtained seem to justify the following statements:

1. Assuming that attitudes are distributed normally, a method of measuring attitudes has been developed which uses sigma units. This method not only retains most of the advantages present in methods now used, such as yielding scores the units of which are equal throughout the entire range, but it has additional advantages. These briefly are: first, the method does away with the use of raters or judges and the errors arising therefrom; second, it is less laborious to construct an attitude scale by this method; and third, the method yields the same reliability with fewer items.

2. A simpler method was found which yielded essentially the same reliability coefficient as the sigma method and correlated so well with this (+.99) that it seems justifiable for all ordinary purposes to use the simpler method. The simpler technique involved the assigning of consecutive numerical values to the different alternatives. (On pages 15-20 the numbers in parentheses below the different alternatives show the numerical values assigned.) After assigning the numerical values to the different possible responses, the score for each individual was determined by finding the average or sum of the numerical values of the alternatives that he checked.

3. A scale measuring attitudes toward international relations constructed by the simpler method when compared with the Thurstone-Droba War scale yielded the same reliability coefficients with practically one-half as many items. The coefficients of correlation between the two scales for two different groups was respectively +.71 and +.65. When corrected for attenuation these coefficients became +.81 and +.75. This relationship is obtained in spite of the fact that the statements in the two scales are quite dissimilar.

4. Applying this simpler method of scoring to the statements in the Thurstone-Droba scale and using eighteen of the twenty-two statements in each form the uncorrected reliability coefficient obtained for Form A versus Form B was .88. The Thurstone method of scoring for all twenty-two items in each form yielded an uncorrected coefficient of correlation between the two forms of .78. The uncorrected coefficient of correlation between the scores obtained by the two methods was +.83, corrected, +.92.

5. Methods of objectively checking the statements included in a scale are presented to assist the experimenter in the construction of attitude scales.

6. While the present monograph aims chiefly to describe a technique rather than generalized results, it is noteworthy that in practice the three scales yield, contrary to the writer's expectation, very clear-cut generalized attitudes on "internationalism," "imperialism," and "the Negro," in addition to the specific attitudes which appear in response to the separate questions.
